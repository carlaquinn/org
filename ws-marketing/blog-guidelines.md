# Inclusive Naming Initiative Blog Guidelines #

## Overview ##

The Inclusive Naming Initiative's blog serves as a channel for INI to share content with the community at large, as well as a home for press releases.

The content on our blog consists of:
* Articles about projects related to the INI's work 
* Use cases and success stories from people, projects, and organizations using INI's work

Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the Inclusive Naming Initiative's work.

We accept content in support of INI's mission. The content can be original or published within the last 2 months.


## Content ##

The Inclusive Naming Initiative blog audience is developers, open source maintainers, and other people managing codebases. Keep this in mind as you develop your blog content.

Some things to think about:

* While we encourage the submission of use cases and other stories, the Inclusive Naming Initiative blog is not intended as an advertising channel.

* The most interesting posts are implementation case studies or other practical content to help developers make naming changes.

Members can add 1-2 sentences at the end of their blog with a link to an external site such as their website. Examples for best practices:
* Share contact info of  speaker - twitter, slack, email
* Links to company websites
* Links to projects websites or Github

INI will review the statement, as we do for the content for the blog, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes. 

## Promotion ##
Your blog will be shared on INI's Twitter account. Please feel free to retweet or share.

## How to submit for consideration ##

Please submit a brief summary and the topic of the post to pr@inclusivenaming.org for consideration. Or you can supply the blog for review by creating a PR in the [blog folder](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/website/tree/main/content/blog/_posts). We will respond with a proposed date of publication or if itâ€™s not suitable for the INI blog, we will provide feedback and direction.
